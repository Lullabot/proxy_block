# E2E Test Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The E2E tests have been refactored to focus exclusively on Proxy Block specific functionality, removing tests that verify Drupal core features. This document summarizes the changes and ensures comprehensive coverage of proxy block functionality.

## Refactoring Changes

### 1. working-proxy-block.spec.js → Proxy Block Target Configuration

**Before**: Mixed proxy functionality with generic Drupal testing (authentication, form validation, region placement)  
**After**: Focused on proxy-specific target block selection and configuration

**Key Test Areas**:

- Target block selection dropdown availability and options
- Target block selection persistence across save/edit cycles
- Target block content rendering through proxy
- Target block selection validation (required field)
- Multiple target block configurations
- AJAX functionality when selecting target blocks
- Target block configuration form loading
- Context passing from proxy to target block

### 2. block-placement.spec.js → Proxy Block Configuration Settings

**Before**: Primarily Drupal core block placement UI testing (generic placement, region discovery, basic form submission)  
**After**: Focused on proxy-specific configuration settings and validation

**Key Test Areas**:

- Proxy block access with target block field present
- Target block selection during configuration
- Saving proxy block with target configuration
- Multiple target block configurations persistence
- Proxy-specific settings validation
- Target block settings AJAX updates
- Settings persistence during configuration updates

### 3. render.spec.js → Proxy Block Rendering

**Before**: Mixed proxy rendering with generic content creation, region testing, basic rendering  
**After**: Focused on proxy-specific rendering behavior

**Key Test Areas**:

- Target block content rendering through proxy
- Different target blocks rendering correctly
- Proxy block title display settings (visible/hidden)
- Proxy block cache handling
- Context passing from proxy to target block
- Proxy block permission handling
- Graceful error handling in proxy rendering

## Proxy Block Specific Features Covered

### ✅ Core Proxy Functionality

1. **Target Block Selection**: Dropdown selection, options availability, persistence
2. **Target Block Configuration**: Settings loading, AJAX updates, validation
3. **Target Block Rendering**: Content proxying, title handling, cache behavior
4. **Context Mapping**: Context passing from proxy to target (covered in existing context-mapping.spec.js)

### ✅ Proxy-Specific Settings

1. **Target Block Validation**: Required field validation for target selection
2. **Settings Persistence**: Configuration preservation across edits
3. **AJAX Behavior**: Target-specific configuration loading via AJAX
4. **Title Display**: Proxy block title visibility settings

### ✅ Proxy-Specific Rendering

1. **Content Proxying**: Target block content rendering through proxy
2. **Cache Handling**: Proxy-specific cache behavior
3. **Permission Handling**: Proxy respecting target block permissions
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of rendering errors
5. **Context Passing**: Proper context transfer to target blocks

### ✅ Integration Testing

1. **Multiple Target Types**: Testing with different target block types
2. **Configuration Persistence**: Settings maintained across save/edit cycles
3. **Frontend Rendering**: End-to-end proxy block display
4. **User Permissions**: Anonymous vs authenticated user access

## Removed Drupal Core Testing

### ❌ Authentication/User Management

- Login/logout functionality (delegated to drush helper setup)
- User permission testing (except proxy-specific permission handling)
- Generic admin interface access

### ❌ Content Creation

- Node creation UI testing
- Generic content management
- Content type creation

### ❌ Block System Core

- Generic block placement UI
- Region discovery and listing
- Basic block removal functionality
- Generic form submission and validation

### ❌ Frontend Core

- Basic page loading without PHP errors (except in context of proxy rendering)
- Generic region placement testing
- General theme/layout testing

## Test Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Test Count**: From ~15 sprawling tests to ~13 focused tests
2. **Faster Execution**: Removed generic UI testing and content creation
3. **Better Reliability**: Focused tests are less likely to break due to unrelated changes
4. **Clearer Purpose**: Each test now has a specific proxy block feature to validate

## Coverage Verification

### Target Block Selection

- ✅ Dropdown availability and options
- ✅ Selection persistence
- ✅ Required field validation
- ✅ Multiple target types support

### Target Block Configuration

- ✅ Configuration loading and saving
- ✅ AJAX functionality
- ✅ Settings persistence
- ✅ Validation behavior

### Target Block Rendering

- ✅ Content proxying
- ✅ Title display options
- ✅ Cache behavior
- ✅ Permission handling
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Context passing

### Integration & Edge Cases

- ✅ Multiple configurations
- ✅ Frontend rendering
- ✅ User permission scenarios
- ✅ Error scenarios

## Test Structure Improvements

1. **Clear Test Names**: Each test clearly indicates what proxy functionality is being tested
2. **Focused Assertions**: Tests verify specific proxy behavior rather than generic Drupal functionality
3. **Proper Setup/Teardown**: Tests clean up proxy blocks specifically
4. **Consistent Patterns**: All tests follow similar patterns for proxy configuration

## Maintenance Benefits

1. **Reduced Brittleness**: Tests won't break due to unrelated Drupal core changes
2. **Clear Failures**: When tests fail, it's clear what proxy functionality is broken
3. **Easier Debugging**: Focused tests make it easier to identify issues
4. **Better Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation for proxy block features

## Recommendations

1. **Keep Tests Focused**: Continue to resist adding generic Drupal testing to these files
2. **Regular Review**: Periodically review tests to ensure they remain proxy-specific
3. **Add New Features**: When adding new proxy features, ensure E2E tests cover the new functionality
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track test execution time to ensure tests remain fast and reliable

This refactoring successfully transforms the E2E test suite from a mixed bag of Drupal core and proxy functionality testing into a focused, comprehensive validation of Proxy Block's unique features.
